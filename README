About
=====

This is the firmware, running on an stm32f4 eval board, for a radio managment panel (RMP) of QPAC A320 X-Plane airplane. It registers dataref at (a modified) teensy X-Plane_Plugin from github.com/schenlap/X-Plane_Plugin and lets you set radio and nav frequencies and courses.

The usage of the RPM differs from the original RMP or the simulate RMP in QPAC A320 to be useable in a more generic way and later in different aircrafts.
